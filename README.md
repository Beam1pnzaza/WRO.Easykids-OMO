  Welcome to the documentation of Team Easykids-OMO's remarkable journey in the prestigious World Robot Olympiad 2023 (WRO). This document is a testament to the dedication, creativity, and ingenuity displayed by us, throughout this exciting and challenging competition.

  The WRO provided a unique platform for young robotics enthusiasts like us to showcase our skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. As part of this extraordinary event, we set out to design and build a robot capable of overcoming various obstacles, detecting colors, recognizing objects, and making critical decisions in real-time.

  Our journey began three months before the competition, and the initial stages were dedicated to meticulous planning and design. We envisioned a small yet stable robot, equipped with cutting-edge sensors and driven by powerful motor control systems, to navigate the challenging WRO tasks.

  Through weeks of hard work, we fine-tuned our robot's code and utilized the OpenCV library to detect and differentiate between blue and orange colors, essential for accurate path tracking. The integration of a gyroscopic sensor further enhanced our robot's agility and stability during turns and movements.

  Our team is immensely proud of achieving seamless cooperation between two types of motor control: DC motors for driving and servo motors for precise turning. The combination of these elements allowed our robot to maneuver swiftly and with remarkable accuracy.

  This documentation aims to provide an in-depth account of our robot's design, the techniques employed for color detection, algorithm development, and the challenges faced and overcome during our preparation. Additionally, we share insights into the future improvements we envision, driving us to strive for continuous innovation and excellence in the field of robotics.

  We hope that this documentation not only serves as a testament to our hard work and determination but also inspires fellow robotics enthusiasts and future competitors. The WRO has been a transformative experience for us, fostering our passion for robotics, teamwork, and the pursuit of knowledge. We extend our gratitude to all who supported us throughout this journey, and we hope you find this documentation both informative and inspiring. Let's embark on this exhilarating journey together, exploring the realm of robotics and the incredible possibilities it offers.

## üè¢ 1.Working Process üë®üèº‚Äçüíº
Our journey to the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) competition was an exciting and challenging experience. As a team, we invested dedicated effort and time into the development and preparation of our robot. Here is a summary of our working process leading up to the competition:
- **Week 1-2: Designing the Robot Structure**

  We began our journey by brainstorming and designing the structure of our robot. Our main objectives were to create a compact and stable robot capable of maneuvering through various terrains and obstacles in the WRO competition. After careful consideration, we finalized the design and started gathering the required components.
  
- **Week 3-4: Code Implementation and Testing**

  With the robot structure in place, we delved into the coding phase. Our primary focus was on ensuring the robot could run smoothly and execute basic movements. We integrated the motor control and sensor interfaces and started writing the initial lines of code. As we encountered challenges, we iteratively tested and debugged the code to ensure reliability and stability.
  
- **Week 5-6: Color Detection Algorithm Development**

  As color detection was a crucial aspect of the WRO competition, we dedicated specific weeks to develop the HSV-based color detection algorithm. The first step was obtaining the initial HSV values for color detection. We allowed the user to interactively select the desired color through the robot's camera, and the algorithm printed the corresponding HSV values. We then implemented a fine-tuning process using thresholding to achieve precise color detection.
  
- **Week 7-8: Documentation and Preparing for the Competition**
  
  To document our progress and efforts, we worked on comprehensive documentation describing our robot's design, algorithm, and development process. This documentation served as a record of our journey and also provided insights into our problem-solving approach.

### ‚û°Practice and Learning: Continuous Improvement

Throughout the entire process, we practiced and rehearsed with our robot regularly. We aimed to solve immediate problems, refine our coding techniques, and optimize the robot's performance. Every challenge we encountered was an opportunity for learning and growth.

### ‚û°Final Preparations: The Road to WRO

In the weeks leading up to the competition, we intensified our practice sessions and participated in mock competitions to simulate the real event. These practice sessions allowed us to fine-tune our strategies, calibrate the robot, and gain confidence in its capabilities.

### ‚û°Competition Week: Putting Our Best Foot Forward

As the WRO competition week approached, we were well-prepared and determined to give our best performance. We had meticulously tested and validated our robot's color detection, navigation, and gyroscopic stabilization. Our hard work and dedication culminated in a robot that was ready to face the challenges of the competition.

Our journey to the WRO competition taught us the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and continuous improvement. Each step in our working process contributed to the success of our robot and made the entire experience memorable and rewarding. We were proud of our accomplishments and looked forward to showcasing our robot's capabilities at the prestigious WRO competition.
