 ## ü§ñ3.How Robot Work üë∑
The robot operates through a sophisticated program utilizing two types of motor control: DC motors for driving and servo motors for turning. The program employs the power of OpenCV to check for blue and orange colors, enabling the robot to detect the distance of the line and make precise turns. Additionally, a distance sensor aids in detecting the edge of the field, allowing the robot to navigate within the confines of the designated area.
With the newly incorporated gyroscope, the robot gains increased stability and agility during turns. The gyroscope facilitates fast and stable rotations, enhancing the overall performance of the robot.
To ensure seamless navigation, the robot also utilizes OpenCV Color detection to identify traffic signs. Upon detecting a traffic sign, the program commands the robot to reverse itself, enabling it to adjust its direction and follow the appropriate path.
Through the fusion of advanced motor control, real-time image processing with OpenCV, and the added stability from the gyroscope, our robot confidently maneuvers through the competition arena. This well-crafted program allows the robot to accurately detect colors, follow lines, and respond swiftly to traffic signs and obstacles, making it a formidable contender in the World Robot Olympiad competition.

## 5. Technique Detect üîç
In the field of robotics, color detection plays a crucial role in various applications, such as object recognition, obstacle avoidance, and path planning. One popular method for color detection is using the Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) color space. This technique offers several advantages over other color spaces, making it a popular choice for many robotic applications. Additionally, using thresholding with HSV values allows for more accurate color detection, enabling robots to make precise decisions based on the detected colors.
### ‚û°HSV Color Space: 
HSV is a color space that represents colors in terms of their human perception, making it more intuitive and easier to work with than the RGB color space. It consists of three components:
- **Hue (H):**	Represents the color's dominant wavelength and is often visualized as a color wheel, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. It allows for easy identification of different colors without considering their brightness or intensity.
