  Welcome to the documentation of Team Easykids-OMO's remarkable journey in the prestigious World Robot Olympiad 2023 (WRO). This document is a testament to the dedication, creativity, and ingenuity displayed by us, throughout this exciting and challenging competition.

  The WRO provided a unique platform for young robotics enthusiasts like us to showcase our skills, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities. As part of this extraordinary event, we set out to design and build a robot capable of overcoming various obstacles, detecting colors, recognizing objects, and making critical decisions in real-time.

  Our journey began three months before the competition, and the initial stages were dedicated to meticulous planning and design. We envisioned a small yet stable robot, equipped with cutting-edge sensors and driven by powerful motor control systems, to navigate the challenging WRO tasks.

  Through weeks of hard work, we fine-tuned our robot's code and utilized the OpenCV library to detect and differentiate between blue and orange colors, essential for accurate path tracking. The integration of a gyroscopic sensor further enhanced our robot's agility and stability during turns and movements.

  Our team is immensely proud of achieving seamless cooperation between two types of motor control: DC motors for driving and servo motors for precise turning. The combination of these elements allowed our robot to maneuver swiftly and with remarkable accuracy.

  This documentation aims to provide an in-depth account of our robot's design, the techniques employed for color detection, algorithm development, and the challenges faced and overcome during our preparation. Additionally, we share insights into the future improvements we envision, driving us to strive for continuous innovation and excellence in the field of robotics.

  We hope that this documentation not only serves as a testament to our hard work and determination but also inspires fellow robotics enthusiasts and future competitors. The WRO has been a transformative experience for us, fostering our passion for robotics, teamwork, and the pursuit of knowledge. We extend our gratitude to all who supported us throughout this journey, and we hope you find this documentation both informative and inspiring. Let's embark on this exhilarating journey together, exploring the realm of robotics and the incredible possibilities it offers.
